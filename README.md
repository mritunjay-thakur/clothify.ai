## 🎯 The Spark Behind Clothify

Picture this: an AI that doesn't just answer questions but _gets you_ – understands your love for both sarees and sneakers, knows exactly what skincare works in Mumbai's humidity, and can suggest the perfect outfit for a Diwali party. That's **Taara**!

Born from late-night chai sessions and countless fashion magazines, **Clothify.Ai** is my attempt to create that perfect digital fashion friend we all wish we had. She's part stylist, part skincare expert, and 100% your cheerleader!
